# Stacker
Minecraft mod to change the stack size of all items.

Note: This mod has a config that defaults to 64. Change it to be whatever you like (below int_max), but I do not recommend anything too far over 1 Billion (No support will be given for stacks larger than 1,073,741,823).

Requires Stacc API and Cloth Config API. Modmenu is recommended, but not needed. Stacc API is an embedded library, don't worry about downloading it.
